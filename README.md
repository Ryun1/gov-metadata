# Governance Metadata Testing

This repo contains examples of what off-chain governance metadata anchors could look like.

I have based the metadata on [CIP-0100? | Governance Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556) at commit [68b35d7](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556/).

I used [this Blake2b-256](https://toolkitbay.com/tkb/tool/BLAKE2b_256) hashing tool to create the hashes.

### Examples

#### Governance Action
- [ga.jsonld](./ga.jsonld)
- Hash: `6f4ccf14a00a3986a0e5e5bbefb1cf7135fa861686e9edbe4e08bc992835704b`
- Accessible URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryun1/metadata/main/ga.jsonld

### Motivation
- To have a tool to visually show people what metadata anchors could look like.
- To have some mock data to use during development of tooling.
