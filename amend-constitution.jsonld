The new Constitution has been proposed on chain through a New Constitution Governance Action. However, an anonymous 36% of DRep stake has voted “No” on the proposal for several weeks in a row. No DRep that has voted no will come forward to explain why they have voted against the Constitution.",

After receiving the funds, it was revealed that the supporting analytics data had been faked, and CarDoggo had in fact invested all of the funds in Solana. They must be held accountable for their actions, we must fund a lawsuit against them.",
      "rationale": "By lowering the Update Constitution DRep threshold (dvtUpdateToConstitution) from 75% to 60%. We will be able to get the final constitution ratified and enacted."
